I'm passionate about learning from my peers, and forwarding my knowledge and insights to fellow students. I'm also heavily invested in pageantry arts and the effect music has on connecting the world.
			<br><br>Outside of classes, I spend my free time as a tutor for Northeastern's <a href="https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2500/">Fundamentals of Computer Science course</a>. I'm also the president of <a href="https://nuhacks.io/">NUHacks</a>, a club at Northeastern geared towards hackers, creators, and breakers. When I have time to work on personal projects, I help develop <a href="https://searchneu.com/">SearchNEU</a>, a site that helps Northeastern students search for classes.

			I am currently employed as a Software Engineer Intern for the Routers and Switches team at Datto, Inc.
