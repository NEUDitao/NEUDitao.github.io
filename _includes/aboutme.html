          I'm a Software Engineer employed at <a href="https://www.read.ai/">Read AI</a>, where I work on the
          Experiences team.
          <br /><br />
          In 2025, I completed a thru-hike of the 2197.4 mile Appalachian Trail! You can read about my adventures on <a

          <br /><br />
          In my free time, you can either catch playing board games with friends (my current obsession is Dune:

          I am also an amateur rock climber and ultra-runner. <br /><br />
          I live with my wonderful VOID cat <a href="https://eddyli.dev/kaine.jpg">Kain√©</a> in the Cap Hill district of
          Seattle, WA.
          <br /><br />
          I also used to be involved in the pageantry arts, (Drum Corps, WGI Indoor Percussion). You can usually find me
          as a member of United Percussion's
          volunteer staff at New England events and World Class Finals. I marched in the following shows:
