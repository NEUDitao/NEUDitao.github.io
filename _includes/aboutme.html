          I'm a Software Engineer at Meta, Inc. working on Mobile Networking Services, which works on anticipating and addressing problems
          in cross-functional mobile networking.
          <br /><br />
          In my free time, you can either catch playing board games with friends (my current obsession is Dune: Imperium!),
          worrying about my journal, or continuing to flesh out my <a href="https://backloggery.com/cheeseisland">backlog</a>.
          I am also an amateur rock climber, and will usually go to <a href="https://centralrockgym.com/northstation/">CRG North Station</a>
          to get my fix.
          <br /><br />
          I live with my wonderful VOID cat Kain√© in beautiful Cambridge, MA.
          <br /><br />
          I also used to be involved in the pagenatry arts, (Drum Corps, WGI Indoor Percussion). You can usually find me as a member of United Percussion's 
          volunteer staff at New England events and World Class Finals. I marched in the following shows:
