description: <a href="https://searchneu.com/">SearchNEU</a> is a website that allows students to quickly and easily search up Northeastern classes. I help develop features and fix bugs for the code base, most notably overhauling a notification system which notified students of classes they were watching over Facebook messenger. I also helped smooth out the migration of the codebase from its original owner to its new maintainers.
