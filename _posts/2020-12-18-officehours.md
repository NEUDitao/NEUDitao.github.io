description: <a href="https://khouryofficehours.com/">Khoury Office Hours</a> is a website that I contribute to that was made for Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. A club at school I'm in, Sandbox, was commissioned to create this website, and I serve as one of the founding developers. The site allows for easy creation of office hours queues, and allows for TAs to help students online seamlessly.
