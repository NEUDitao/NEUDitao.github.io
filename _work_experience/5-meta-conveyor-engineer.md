I worked on the Conveyor team, which is the Continuous Deployment Platform at Meta.
On the team, I work mostly on facilitating the migration of Meta from Conveyor2, an older slower system written in Python,
to Conveyor3, a newer system written in Rust that provides Meta engineers more flexibility for their deployments. For more information, check out [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFxeWZDPU3o) from Systems @ Scale 2023.
