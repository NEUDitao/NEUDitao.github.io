At Akamai, I was on the Technical Support team, helping the full-timers troubleshoot network connectivity issues, slowdowns, and configuration issues on the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform. I also served as the internal scripter for the team, creating tools to assist with the cleaning up of old, large files on Linux servers used by Engineers, as well as assisting on the design of a "Quest" system to game-ify learning.
