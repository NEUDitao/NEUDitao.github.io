I was on the Datto Networking Routers & Switches team, where we build software to help our Managed Service Providers monitor and control managed network devices, most specifically, routers and switches. At my time here, I scrubbed our front end of all XSS vulnerabilities, as well as created a Docker environment for our events pipeline, allowing our developers to easily get set up, and develop. During my time here, I learned how to push out effective code efficiently, by the time I left, we were set to finish our new managed switches in 2/3rds the projected amount of time it'd take.
