I was on the Payments Infrastructure team, where we built internal tools to help other Facebook engineers adopt payments within the company. At my time there, I helped to create a web tool which assisted engineers in mapping out the work needed to adopt payment tools for their services. It used Hack and reflection/meta-programming to determine what needed to be done by engineers, and then organized these steps into an actionable workflow. The tool also did some metrics tracking on endpoints to allow engineers to know which endpoints were receiving what types of traffic.
