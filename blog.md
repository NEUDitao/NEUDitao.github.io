For all things backpacking/Appalachian Trail related, please refer to my blog on
[The Trek](https://thetrek.co/author/edward-li/). The blog includes:
  - my pre-trail prep
  - my gear list
  - the daily updates I wrote while on trail
  - some follow up posts reflecting on the journey
  - possibly a future guidebook ;)

If you aren't already there, you're probably looking for some engineering insights I have. Who knows, maybe there will be some here someday.
