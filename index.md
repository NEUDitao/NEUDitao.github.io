I'm a Software Engineer employed at [Read AI](https://www.read.ai/), where I work on the Experiences team.
I've also formerly worked at Meta. More details on my [work experience](/work-experience/) page.

And if you're interested in the rest of me... read on...

### The Other Stuff

In 2025, I completed a thru-hike of the 2197.4 mile Appalachian Trail! You can read about my adventures on [The Trek](https://thetrek.co/author/edward-li/).

In my free time, you can either catch playing board games with friends (my current obsession is Dune: Imperium!),
worrying about my journal, or continuing to flesh out my video game [backlog](https://backloggery.com/cheeseisland).
I am also an amateur rock climber and ultra-runner.

I live with my wonderful void cat [Kain√©](assets/kaine.jpg) in the Cap Hill district of Seattle, WA.

I also used to be involved in the pageantry arts, (Drum Corps, WGI Indoor Percussion). You can usually find me as a member of United Percussion's volunteer staff at New England events and World Class Finals. I marched in the following shows:

- [Pioneer 2016: The Story of St. Joan of Arc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3auDQt_kfpQ&ab_channel=DrumCorpsInternational)  28th Place
- [Cavaliers 2017: Men Are From Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbflNCc0xyM&ab_channel=DrumCorpsInternational) \| 4th Place
- [Cavaliers 2018: On Madness and Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EVewWH8Pz4&ab_channel=DrumCorpsInternational) \| 6th Place
- [Cavaliers 2019: The Wrong Side of the Tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlEW28HxMME&ab_channel=DrumCorpsInternational) \| 5th Place
- [United Percussion 2020: Searching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EquwZwECJkM&ab_channel=UnitedPercussion) \| *Season Cut Short Due to COVID-19 Pandemic*
- [United Percussion 2022: The World is Watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5SuQ0MKM) \| 6th Place

If your local marching group is in need of a front ensemble instructor, I can help! (and I don't expect to be paid!) (as time allows)
